Project Name: SolarAccess
Project Overview:
SolarAccess is a comprehensive solution designed to empower remote and underserved communities with access to renewable energy, focusing on solar power. The project leverages simple, yet effective technologies such as USSD, SMS, and Airtime APIs to provide energy access, flexible payment options, real-time monitoring, and automated customer support without the need for internet connectivity.

Key Features:
USSD and SMS-Based Energy Management:

Allow users to check their energy usage, purchase energy credits, and manage their accounts using basic mobile phones via USSD codes and SMS.
Provide energy usage alerts and account notifications through SMS.
Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) for Solar Products:

Implement a flexible payment model using Airtime APIs that enables users to purchase solar panels and energy products on a BNPL basis.
Users can pay for solar products in small, manageable installments deducted from their mobile airtime balance.
Real-Time Energy Monitoring:

Utilize a simple Insights API to provide energy providers with real-time data on energy usage and potential fraud detection.
Allow users to monitor their energy consumption and budget more effectively through periodic SMS updates.
Automated Customer Support:

Develop a basic chatbot using Chat API that can respond to common user queries regarding energy bills, top-ups, and outages.
The chatbot can be accessed via SMS, providing instant responses without internet access.
